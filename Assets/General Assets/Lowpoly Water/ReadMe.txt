Thank you for choosing Lowpoly Water !
Now you can add lowpoly water in your project easily.

Features:
  1. Shallow water color and deep water color.
  2. Dynamic reflection.
  3. Dynamic refraction.
  4. Stylized foam at water & mesh intersection.
  5. Various water surface wave algorithm. Include gerstner wave, overlay curve wave, radial wave and directional wave.

Package key contents:
  => Script "WaterUtils.cs" contains some helper funtion to do some useful mathematics.
  => Script "WaterCamera.cs" used to render the reflection and refraction map, attach it to your main camera in scene.
  => Script "Water.cs" is the core of demo scene logic, it generates the lowpoly water surface and setup all necessary material parameters.
  => Shader "Lowpoly Water.shader" used to render the lowpoly water surface.
The demo scene demonstrates all features, please refer it as usage example.
Use W, S, A, D move camera, hold left button move cursor rotate camera.
